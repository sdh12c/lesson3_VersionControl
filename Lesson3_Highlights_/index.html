            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that allows users to recall versions of a file later on after changes have been made. It involves one repository for all files where the users (such as team members of a development team) can check any of the files out, make their own changes, then commit the files back to the repository. This solves any problems with file sharing such as editing a file simultaneously. It is also easier than saving multiple files which can become a problem when dealing with more than a handful of files. Version control can be achieved through a version control system.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is very useful to developers since it allows for revision history (details on who changed the files in the repository), details when the files were changes, details what about the files are changed, and it merges these changes so they are in the same file. It is also useful because files cannot be overwritten, the main repository holds the files, people can work on the same files without issue, allows for a reversion to an older version, and it backups files. There are many different kinds too; local version control systems, centralized version control systems, and distributed version control systems.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">DVCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Distributed Version Control System (or DVCS) covers the flaws of the other VCSs quite well. In this system, it is not a matter of checking out files or snapshots; the user essentially receives the full repository. This is useful in case a server dies; the server can be restored just by backing up any of the users’ repositories. With this systems, it’s also easier to set up multiples types of workflows so different users can work in different ways with each other on the same file, project, or whatever they are working on. An example of this would be Git.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As mentioned, Git is a distributed version control system. The key difference between Git and other VCSs is that Git sees data as snapshots rather than a list of file-based changes. For every state saved, a snapshot is taking and a reference is stored of that version of the file. If there was no change, it will not be stored again. Also, everything is local to the user so the speed of tasks is high, making changes happen almost instantly. Finally, Git only ever adds data so it is hard to mess things up without being able to revert changes.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Commands are very much needed to use Git. The first command to know is “git init”, which initializes the repository. Next is “git add .”, which adds all files that were changed since the last backup. ‘Git commit -m “...”’ commits the changes to the repository. “Git push” does as it says: it pushes the changes in the local repository to the remote. “Git pull” again is pretty self-explanatory: it pulls the changes in a remote repository to the local (so the opposite of push). “Git clone ____” will clone the remote repository to the local folder of the user. “Git log” shows all the backups created. “Git status” shows all the files that were changed since the last back up and which ones are added. “Git blame ____” will show who wrote what code. Finally, “git diff” shows the differences between the current directory and the repository back ups.
